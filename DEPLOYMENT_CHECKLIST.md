# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### âœ… Files Ready for Deployment

- [x] `run.py` - Optimized for Railway with proper port handling
- [x] `app.py` - Enhanced with logging and environment-based CORS
- [x] `requirements.txt` - Updated with all necessary dependencies
- [x] `railway.json` - Railway configuration file
- [x] `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration for system dependencies
- [x] `.gitignore` - Properly configured for sensitive files
- [x] `profilingiris-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-5a10da7e73.json` - Firebase credentials
- [x] `models/` directory with ML models
- [x] `api/` directory with Flask blueprints
- [x] `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Detailed deployment guide

### âœ… Code Optimizations

- [x] Production-ready server configuration (Waitress)
- [x] Environment-based CORS settings
- [x] Enhanced health check endpoint with system monitoring
- [x] Proper logging configuration
- [x] Firebase integration with error handling
- [x] Optimized for Railway's resource limits

### âœ… Security Measures

- [x] Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- [x] CORS properly configured for production
- [x] Firebase service account authentication
- [x] Input validation and error handling

## Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Repository
```bash
# Ensure all files are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Railway Setup
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect GitHub account
3. Create new project from GitHub repo
4. Railway auto-detects Flask app

### 3. Environment Variables
Set in Railway dashboard:
```
FLASK_ENV=production
API_VERSION=1.0.0
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*  # Change to your domain in production
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS=profilingiris-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-5a10da7e73.json
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Health check responds: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- [ ] API endpoints work: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/predict`

## Post-Deployment

### Testing
- [ ] Test iris extraction endpoint
- [ ] Test prediction endpoints
- [ ] Verify Firebase integration
- [ ] Check system monitoring

### Production Configuration
- [ ] Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with actual frontend domain
- [ ] Set up custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts
- [ ] Set up backup strategy

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor Railway metrics (CPU, Memory)
- [ ] Check application logs
- [ ] Monitor Firebase usage
- [ ] Test with realistic load

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build fails**: Check `requirements.txt` and build logs
2. **App won't start**: Verify `run.py` and port configuration
3. **Firebase errors**: Check credentials file and environment variables
4. **Model loading**: Ensure models are in repository and paths are correct

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Connect to Railway shell (if needed)
railway shell
```

## Success Indicators

âœ… **Deployment Successful When:**
- Railway build completes without errors
- Health check returns status "healthy"
- All API endpoints respond correctly
- Firebase integration works
- System monitoring shows normal resource usage

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Update frontend to use new Railway URL
2. Test end-to-end functionality
3. Monitor performance and logs
4. Set up CI/CD for automatic deployments
5. Consider adding rate limiting for production use

---

**Your Railway URL will be:** `https://[your-project-name].railway.app`

**Key Endpoints:**
- Health: `/health`
- API Info: `/`
- Iris Extraction: `/api/extract-iris`
- Prediction: `/api/predict`
- Efficient Prediction: `/api/predict-efficient`
